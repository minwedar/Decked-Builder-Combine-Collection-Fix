Decked-Builder-Combine-Collection-Fix
=====================================

This script combines individual card counts after two or more collections have been appended together.


For you Magic the Gathering players and collectors, there is a very cool App that works on desktop, Andriod, iOS, and probably other platforms.  I love it and use it all the time, however I found a problem when I wanted to keep seperate collections of cards and sometimes wanted to combine them.  The problem was that the current way to do this as described on Decked Builder web site was to simply open up one collection and simply append more collections to the end of the file.  I found that if you had duplicate cards in each initial collection this didn't work well.  It seemed to just go with the first one it found in the file.

This script is ran AFTER you have appeneded all the collections you want together and simply gathers all the duplicates, if any, into one listing instead of multiple.  This seems to fix my problem and hope someone else might find this useful.  I'm hoping this is just a temporary fix until Decked Builder has a more elegant solution.
